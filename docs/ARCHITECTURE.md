# Game Engine — Architecture

Living architecture document for the engine. Quake 2-style (authoritative client/server), with modern advances: archetype-based ECS, QUIC transport, client-side prediction + reconciliation.

**Status:** Active development — M4 implemented (foundations, ECS, QUIC networking, client-side prediction, slot state machine, handshake validation, delta snapshots with ack bitfield, remote interpolation, entity-based arenas + rapier collision, WASM plugin, lag-compensated hitscan + plugin-driven respawn). See [roadmap](#implementation-roadmap) for milestone status.
**Audience:** author + future contributors.
**Convention:** each section ends with decisions recorded as embedded ADRs. `**Status: implemented**` means the decision is live in code; `**Status: planned**` means it is a design commitment not yet coded. When a decision is extracted to its own file, it moves to `docs/adr/NNNN-title.md`.

---

## Executive summary

Multiplayer engine for arena games (up to 64 players @ 60 Hz), with authoritative dedicated server and client featuring client-side prediction + server reconciliation. Modular Rust monorepo, with a shared core library between client and server, and separate binaries for each role.

**Non-goals:** listen-server, peer-to-peer, MMO/large shards, pure offline single-player (offline runs a local dedicated server).

- *Player* — input/output via client.
- *Developer* — writes game code + tooling.
- *Operator* — runs/monitors dedicated servers.
- *Platform* — OS, GPU, audio, controllers; abstracted via HAL/RHI.
- *Network* — packet transport (QUIC/UDP).
- *Online services* — auth, matchmaking, telemetry, CDN.

### ADR 0001 — Topology: dedicated server only

**Decision:** support dedicated server only (separate, headless process). Offline single-player runs a local dedicated server on loopback.

**Rationale:** authority 100% on server, always. Client is purely I/O terminal + prediction. Server compiles without GPU/audio/input.

**Status: implemented.** `blackflowerd` is headless; `blackflowerc` is the I/O terminal. Both share `blackflower-gameplay` and `blackflower-protocol` but not rendering or window crates.

### ADR 0002 — Target scale: arena ~64 players @ 60 Hz

**Decision:** primary target is arena/shooter up to 64 players @ 60 Hz tickrate.

**Consequences:** snapshot-based networking, client-side prediction, lag-comp via rewind in history buffer, no area-of-interest.

**Status: implemented.** Tick scheduler and QUIC broadcast support the scale target. Delta snapshot compression (M3) is implemented; lag-comp via snapshot-ring rewind (M4) is implemented (`Authority::hit_candidates` rewinds targets to the shooter's acked snapshot).

- Commands and snapshots are distinct channels. Commands = player input (client → server datagram). Snapshots = world state (server → client datagram).
- Requests/Events are reliable control messages carried on QUIC streams (client → server / server → client respectively).

### ADR 0003 — Client/server communication: asymmetric on two channels

**Decision:** two distinct logical channels — commands (client → server) and snapshots (server → client). Both unreliable (QUIC datagrams). Reliable control messages use QUIC streams (COBS-framed).

**Rationale:** snapshots are idempotent in aggregate (tick N+1 supersedes N); reliability adds latency without adding correctness.

**Status: implemented.** Commands and snapshots use `quinn` datagrams. `Request`/`Event` use a single bidirectional QUIC stream per connection with COBS framing.

```

**Implemented components:**

- **Tick scheduler** — `TickScheduler::start(60)` drives a fixed-rate loop. Logs overruns.
- **SimulationWorld** — `hecs`-backed ECS; `EntityIdAllocator` issues monotonic IDs (never reused).
- **Command pipeline** — drains one `Command` per client per tick; applies `apply_player_movement()` then `CollisionWorld::move_and_slide()` (server-authoritative); records `last_processed[client]`.
- **Snapshot builder** — every tick, iterates all `Transform` components; builds `Snapshot { tick, ack: last_processed[client], entities }` and sends as datagram.
- **Session management** — `conn_entities: HashMap<ConnectionId, EntityId>` and `last_processed: HashMap<ConnectionId, Tick>`; `Hello` request spawns entity, disconnect despawns it.
- **Physics** — `integrate_movement()` applied per tick to `(Transform, Velocity)` pairs; player collision via rapier (`blackflower-physics::collision`, server-only — ADR 0018).

**Not yet implemented:**

- Job system (parallelizes inside each system) — single-threaded today.
- Anti-cheat hooks in command pipeline.
- Asset loader / map loading.
- Telemetry sink.

### ADR 0004 — Archetype-based ECS

**Decision:** ECS with archetypes (entities with the same set of components live in contiguous chunks), not sparse-set.

**Rationale:** bulk iteration (simulation pattern) is cache-friendly. `add_component`/`remove_component` is rare and can pay the move-between-archetype cost.

**Status: implemented.** `blackflower-world` wraps `hecs 0.11`.

### ADR 0005 — Fixed 60 Hz tick

**Decision:** server runs a fixed 16.67 ms tick. Inputs arriving mid-tick wait for the next one. Client renderer is variable (independent).

**Rationale:** determinism. Client and server must produce identical results for identical inputs; physics with variable `dt` diverges.

**Status: implemented.** `TickScheduler` drives both server and client tick loops at the configured Hz. Client render and input run on a separate winit event loop thread.

### ADR 0006 — Game logic in a WASM Component Model plugin

**Decision:** server-authoritative game logic lives in a WASM component loaded at runtime by the server, via the interface in `wit/game-plugin.wit`. The host lives in `blackflower-gameplay::plugin` (wasmtime). The engine treats entity properties as opaque bytes (`Prop { id: u16, value: Vec<u8> }`) and never interprets them; the plugin owns the encoding.

**Rationale:** fast iteration and safe sandboxing (capability-gated WASI, no Rust ABI hazard), keeping game rules out of the engine. Supersedes the original cdylib plan (Quake's `game.dll`): the unstable Rust ABI made `#[repr(C)]` shared types fragile, and WASM gives a stable, language-agnostic boundary instead.

**Scope:** only NON-predicted rules go in the plugin (`select-spawn`, `on-spawn`, `on-hit`). Predicted rules stay as pure Rust in `blackflower-gameplay::systems` — see ADR 0017 for the boundary and its rationale. Spawn-point *selection* is a rule and lives in the plugin (`select-spawn` picks an index into the candidates the map offers); the *candidate list* is map data the engine derives (`arena.spawn_points()`).

**Status: implemented.** `wit/game-plugin.wit` defines `select-spawn`/`on-spawn`/`on-hit` plus `save-state`/`load-state`; `blackflower-gameplay::plugin` hosts the component (wasmtime, wasm32-wasip2); `plugins/e1m1` is the first guest. Loaded only by `blackflowerd` (path from CLI). **Hot-reload + state migration (M5):** the authority watches the plugin `.wasm` (`notify` file-watch on the parent dir) and, on the tick thread, reloads it when the file changes — calling `save-state` on the old instance and `load-state` on the new one to carry the plugin's internal state across (opaque bytes; the plugin owns versioning/migration). Entity props live in the engine and survive a reload regardless. A failed reload (bad/partial `.wasm`, migration error) is logged and the current plugin keeps running, so a bad build never drops the session.

---

### ADR 0017 — Game-rule boundary: predicted pure systems vs server-only plugin

**Decision:** game rules are split by whether the client must predict them.

- **Predicted rules** (movement, and any rule whose effect the client must show before the server confirms) stay as **pure functions in `blackflower-gameplay::systems`**, called identically by server (`blackflower-authority`) and client (`blackflower-replica::PredictionState`). They never live in the plugin.
- **Server-authoritative, non-predicted rules** (`on-spawn`, `on-hit`/damage) live in the **WASM Component Model plugin** (`wit/game-plugin.wit`, host in `blackflower-gameplay::plugin`). The plugin is loaded only by `blackflowerd`; the client never instantiates it. The engine treats entity properties as opaque bytes (`Prop { id: u16, value: Vec<u8> }`) and never interprets them.

The ECS itself (storage, scheduling, change detection) is engine mechanism, not game policy, and stays in the engine regardless.

**Rationale:** client-side prediction (ADR 0007) requires the client to run the exact same code as the server for any rule it predicts. A rule that lives only in the server-side plugin cannot be predicted, reintroducing the rubber-banding that prediction exists to remove. Keeping the predicted/non-predicted split explicit prevents a predicted rule from silently landing in the plugin.

**Decision test for any new rule:** *does the client need to predict this?* Yes → pure function in `gameplay::systems`. No → plugin.

**Risk:** if a future predicted rule (e.g. predicted projectiles, weapon recoil) is wanted *inside* the plugin, the plugin must run on both client and server, which adds a hard requirement of **bit-exact determinism** across both (identical wasmtime `Config`, float/SIMD/NaN determinism). Until then, predicted logic stays in pure Rust. Separately, opaque props decouple the engine from game state but block the engine from any logic that needs to understand them (per-type AABBs, HP-bar interpolation); when that need arises, that piece is not actually engine-agnostic.

**Status: implemented.** Refines ADR 0006's mechanism: the plugin is a WASM Component Model component, not a cdylib. Movement (`apply_player_movement`) is shared pure Rust; `select-spawn`/`on-spawn`/`on-hit` are server-only WASM. Hitscan drives `on-hit`: when a command carries `FIRE`, the server casts a ray from the shooter (`blackflower-physics::hitscan::ray_aabb`) against other players' AABBs and runs the nearest hit's props through `on-hit`. Hits are **lag-compensated** — targets are validated against their positions in the snapshot the shooter's client had acked (`command.snapshot_ack_tick`, rewound from the server's `SnapshotRing`), falling back to current positions when that tick has aged out of the ring. `on-hit` returns `hit-result { props, respawn }`: the engine merges `props` by id, and on `respawn` resets the target in place (fresh `next_spawn_transform` + `on-spawn` props, same `EntityId`). Death is the plugin's call since the engine never interprets HP. Aim comes from **mouse-look** (M5): the client accumulates absolute view angles (`Command.yaw/pitch`, raw `DeviceEvent::MouseMotion` × sensitivity, pitch clamped) sent on the wire; the server applies them via the pure `apply_player_look` before movement, so the shooter's facing — and the hitscan ray — point where the player looks. The client is first-person (camera follows the local player's transform; its body is not drawn) and movement is yaw-relative. Look is predicted (rotation rolls back/replays with movement). Fire-rate / edge-detect on `FIRE` is still not implemented (M5 follow-up).

---

### ADR 0018 — Collision: rapier, server-authoritative; entity-based maps

**Decision:** collision lives in `blackflower-physics::collision::CollisionWorld` (rapier3d `KinematicCharacterController` over static cuboid colliders) and runs **only on the server**. The client does not predict collision: it applies the pure movement system and is corrected by snapshots. Maps are entity-based: an arena is an `id` plus a flat list of `MapEntity { classname, props }` (opaque string key/values, Quake style); the engine interprets only the classnames it knows — `solid_brush` (solid `min`/`max`) and `spawn_point` (spawn `origin`) — and passes the rest through untouched.

**Rationale:** per ADR 0017, anything the client predicts must run identically on both sides. Keeping collision server-only avoids putting rapier on the predicted path, which would demand cross-platform bit-determinism (rapier defaults to `simd-stable`, which is non-deterministic). The trade-off is the status quo of mild rubber-banding near walls; acceptable until predicted collision is explicitly wanted. The entity-based map model mirrors real engines and aligns with the opaque-props philosophy (ADR 0017): the engine stays ignorant of gameplay classnames.

**Consequences:** only `blackflower-authority` (server) depends on `blackflower-physics`, so rapier never reaches the client. Promoting collision to the predicted path later means running the same collision code client-side under `enhanced-determinism` (or a shared deterministic sweep) — a deliberate future decision, not an accident.

**Status: implemented.** `blackflower-physics::collision` (rapier3d 0.33); `blackflower-world::arena` parses the entity map and derives `solids()`/`spawn_points()`; `blackflower-authority` builds the `CollisionWorld` in `start()` and applies `move_and_slide` after movement.

```

**Invariants (as implemented):**

1. `drain → apply → simulate` — all inputs ready before simulating.
2. Ack tracked per-client; echoed in snapshot for client reconciliation.
3. Snapshot sent after physics integrate (world is fully committed).
4. Send is N parallel sends via per-client tokio channels; slow clients drop packets, others unaffected.

**Actual per-tick work (current):**

```
1. try_recv_connects()      — insert SlotState::Handshake
2. try_recv_requests()      — Hello: Handshake→Playing (version + capacity check)
                            — Ping: send Pong (NTP clock sync)
3. try_recv_commands()      — apply_player_movement() per Playing client
                            — update baseline_tick from snapshot ack bitfield
4. try_recv_disconnects()   — Playing→Zombie (entity held 5 s)
5. expire_zombies()         — despawn entities past TTL, remove slot
6. integrate_movement()     — Euler integrate all (Transform, Velocity)
7. world.snapshot()         — iterate Transforms, build WorldSnapshot, insert into ring
8. build_delta()            — per Playing client: delta vs baseline or full snapshot
9. try_send_snapshot_to()   — enqueue WorldDelta to per-client channel
```

```

**Implemented components:**

- **Tick thread** — `TickScheduler` at 60 Hz; owns `PresentationWorld`, `PredictionState`, `ClientHandle`.
- **Render thread** — winit event loop; `App` implements `WindowHandler`; reads `FrameBuffer` via `ArcSwap` (lock-free).
- **Input** — `InputHandle` (thread-safe `Arc<Mutex<InputButtons>>`); render thread writes, tick thread reads.
- **PresentationWorld** — upserts entities from server snapshots; `extract()` returns flat `Vec<(EntityId, Transform)]` for renderer.
- **PredictionState** — rollback-replay reconciliation (see ADR 0007).
- **Renderer** — wgpu pipeline; one instanced draw call per frame, per-instance model matrix via SSBO.

**Not yet implemented:**

- Interpolation for remote entities (currently shown at last-known authoritative position).
- Extrapolation / dead reckoning for remote entities under packet loss.
- Audio (`blackflower-audio` is a stub).

### ADR 0007 — Client-side prediction with rollback-replay

**Decision:** client predicts local player input speculatively using the same pure simulation functions as the server. On snapshot arrival, roll back to the server's authoritative state and replay unacked inputs.

**Rationale:** hides RTT latency for local player; eliminates input-induced position error via reconciliation.

**Status: implemented.** `PredictionState` keeps a `VecDeque<HistoryEntry>` ring buffer of 128 ticks (~2.1 s @ 60 Hz). On each tick:

1. **predict(tick, buttons, seed, dt)** — applies `apply_player_movement()` locally; pushes to history.
2. **reconcile(authoritative, ack, dt)** — drops history entries `tick ≤ ack`, rolls back to server transform, replays remaining inputs in order.
3. **extract** — overwrites local player's transform in `PresentationWorld` before publishing to framebuffer.

`apply_player_movement()` is a pure function shared by `blackflower-gameplay`; server and client run identical code, so prediction is exact given identical inputs and `dt`.

### ADR 0007b — Frame loop: separate tick and render threads

**Decision:** client uses two threads. Tick thread: fixed 60 Hz `TickScheduler`. Render thread: winit event loop at display rate. Data published via lock-free `ArcSwap<Box<[(EntityId, Transform)]>>` framebuffer.

**Rationale:** decouples simulation rate from frame rate. Render never blocks on network I/O; tick never blocks on GPU.

**Status: implemented.** See `bins/blackflowerc/src/main.rs`. `PresentationWorld` maintains up to 8 `TransformSample` entries per entity; `resolve()` in `Replica` computes a clock-estimated target tick and calls `interpolate()` with a 2-tick delay buffer.

---

## Level 3 — Engine core (shared library)

**Principles (as applied in current code):**

1. **Determinism first** — `apply_player_movement()` and `integrate_movement()` are pure functions with no global state, no RNG.
2. **Headless by construction** — server binary has zero GPU/audio/window dependencies.
3. **Vertical dependencies only** — lower-level crates (`blackflower-math`, `blackflower-entity`, `blackflower-protocol`) have no dependencies on higher-level ones.

**Crate dependency order (leaf → root):**

```
blackflower-math
blackflower-entity
blackflower-protocol
blackflower-input   → math

### ADR 0008 — Math: IEEE float throughout; fixed-point deferred

**Decision:** IEEE 754 floats for all simulation math. Q16.16 fixed-point for networked movement is deferred until delta compression (M3) requires it.

**Rationale:** avoids holding development velocity hostage to determinism work where it doesn't yet matter. Clear boundary between wire and simulation types allows migration later.

**Status: implemented (IEEE float in use).** Fixed-point encoding is deferred — no longer tied to M3. `Transform` is `#[repr(C)]` in preparation for a future migration if quantized delta snapshots are ever adopted.

### ADR 0016 — ECS: hecs (not bevy_ecs)

**Decision:** `hecs` as the foundation. Scheduler, change detection, and command buffers are implemented in the engine as a layer over `hecs`.

**Rationale:** avoid architectural coupling to the Bevy ecosystem. `hecs` (~5000 LOC) is auditable; its API has been stable for years. `bevy_ecs` breaks across major versions.

**Trade-offs accepted:** ~2–3 months additional engineering for a custom scheduler; smaller third-party ecosystem.

**Status: implemented.** `blackflower-world` wraps `hecs::World`. No custom scheduler yet — systems are called directly in tick loop order.

```

### Wire format (current implementation)

All messages are serialized with `postcard` (compact binary, little-endian, no schema).

**Command** (client → server, unreliable datagram):

```
tick:              u64   (8 bytes)
buttons:           u64   (8 bytes, InputButtons bitfield)
snapshot_ack_tick: u64   (8 bytes — reference tick for ack window)
snapshot_ack_bits: u32   (4 bytes — bit i set = received tick ack_tick−i)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
                          ~28 bytes per command
```

**WorldDelta** (server → client, unreliable datagram):

```
tick:     u64             (8 bytes)
ack:      u64             (8 bytes — highest client command tick processed)
baseline: u64             (8 bytes — 0 = full snapshot; N = delta vs tick N)
removed:  [u64]           (varint count + removed entity IDs × 8 bytes)
entities: [EntityDelta]   (varint count + N entries)

EntityDelta:
  id:          u64                 (8 bytes)
  translation: Option<[f32; 3]>   (1 + 12 bytes if present, 1 byte if absent)
  rotation:    Option<[f32; 4]>   (1 + 16 bytes if present, 1 byte if absent)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Full snapshot:  ~24 + N × 30 bytes
Delta snapshot: ~24 + removed × 8 + changed × 2–30 bytes (only dirty fields)
```

Server keeps last 32 `WorldSnapshot`s in `SnapshotRing` (indexed by `tick % 32`).
Change detection uses `f32::to_bits()` (bit-exact, handles −0/NaN correctly).

**Control messages** (QUIC stream, COBS-framed, zero-terminated):

```
Request::Hello { protocol_version: u32 }           (client → server, ~5 bytes)
Request::Ping  { client_send_ns: u64 }             (client → server, ~9 bytes)
Event::Welcome { tick_hz: u64, assigned_entity_id: u64 }  (server → client, ~17 bytes)
Event::Rejected { reason: RejectReason }           (server → client, ~2–9 bytes)
Event::Pong    { client_send_ns: u64, server_tick: u64 }  (server → client, ~17 bytes)
```

**Bandwidth (post M3 delta compression, static-world baseline):**

- Full snapshot @ 64 entities: ≈ 1.9 KB
- Delta snapshot (typical active match): ≈ 50–400 bytes depending on movement
- Downstream per client @ 60 Hz (active): ≈ 3–24 KB/s
- Quantization deferred indefinitely (see ADR 0008)

### ADR 0009 — Transport: QUIC datagrams (hot) + QUIC streams (bulk)

**Decision:** QUIC with datagrams (RFC 9221) for hot state (commands + snapshots), streams for control (requests + events). Mandatory TLS 1.3.

**Rationale:** QUIC gives encrypted handshake, mature congestion control, connection migration, 0-RTT on reconnects.

**Dev caveat:** self-signed certs and `SkipServerVerification` are used in development. Both server and client accept `--fake-latency-ms` / `--fake-jitter-ms` CLI flags to simulate network conditions locally.

**Status: implemented.** `blackflower-network` wraps `quinn`. Dev cert helpers in `cert.rs`. `DelayQueue` implements per-message latency + jitter.

### ADR 0010 — Reliable events on QUIC streams

**Decision:** critical events (`Hello`, `Welcome`) use a COBS-framed reliable QUIC stream, not application-layer retransmit over datagrams.

**Rationale:** stream reliability is free in QUIC; using it for low-frequency control messages avoids building a custom reliability layer.

**Status: implemented.** One bidirectional stream per connection; framed with `encode_framed`/`decode_framed` (COBS, zero-terminated).

---

## Level 3 — Connection lifecycle (current implementation)

Simplified relative to the full state machine design; implemented states:

```
Client connects (QUIC handshake)
  → server: SlotState::Handshake inserted
  → client sends Request::Hello { protocol_version }
  → server: version check, capacity check
      ✗ mismatch → Event::Rejected { VersionMismatch | ServerFull }
      ✓ ok       → entity spawned, SlotState::Playing, Event::Welcome { tick_hz, assigned_entity_id }
  → client: begins prediction, tick loop starts

Client disconnects / connection drops
  → server: SlotState::Zombie { entity, until: tick + 5 s }
  → entity stays in world (visible to others) during zombie window
  → zombie TTL expires → entity despawned, slot removed
```

**Not yet implemented:** identity-based reconnect (requires auth token in Hello), authentication, lobby, match state machine.

### ADR 0011 — Slot state machine as typed enum

**Decision:** each slot state is a variant of a typed enum with typed payload. Invalid transitions don't compile.

**Status: implemented.** `blackflower-authority` uses `HashMap<ConnectionId, SlotState>` where `SlotState` is a typed enum. Transitions: QUIC connect → `Handshake`; validated `Hello` → `Playing`; disconnect → `Zombie` (5 s TTL); TTL expiry → entity despawned, slot removed. `Free` is implicit (absent from the map). Commands and snapshot broadcasts only reach `Playing` slots.

> Note: `blackflower-entity`, `blackflower-arena`, and `blackflower-plugin` no longer exist as standalone crates — `EntityId`/`EntityIdAllocator` and arena geometry were folded into `blackflower-world`, and the WASM host into `blackflower-gameplay` (M4-A refactor).

### ADR 0014 — Monorepo Cargo workspace

**Decision:** all engine + game + tools crates in a single Git repo, managed as a Cargo workspace.

**Rationale:** atomic refactors, hermetic build, single version across the entire stack.

**Status: implemented.**

### ADR 0015 — Language: Rust

**Decision:** Rust across the runtime stack.

**Rationale:** borrow checker eliminates classes of bugs in multi-threaded ECS; solid ecosystem (`wgpu`, `quinn`); Cargo workspace; `hecs` as ECS foundation.

**Status: implemented.**

## Open decisions

- **Supported client platforms** — Windows + Linux minimum. macOS, consoles: post-launch.
- **Editor: separate native app vs web/Electron** — defer until M5.
- **External anti-cheat** — BattlEye/EAC integration only if there's an actual post-launch problem.
- **Replay/demo system** — possibly "free" if snapshots are persisted; ADR in M3.
- **Spectator mode** — sub-case of replay.
- **In-game voice chat** — out of scope until M7.
- **Fixed-point quantization** — deferred indefinitely; revisit if bandwidth becomes a bottleneck.

---

## Glossary

- **Ack** — the highest client-tick the server has processed; echoed in each `Snapshot` so the client can reconcile prediction history.
- **Archetype** — grouping of entities sharing the same set of component types; contiguous in memory.
- **COBS** — Consistent Overhead Byte Stuffing; framing scheme that eliminates 0x00 bytes so streams can be delimited by a zero byte.
- **Delta compression** — sending only the difference between state N and state N-K (snapshot baseline). Not yet implemented.
- **ECS** — Entity-Component-System; entities are IDs, components are pure data, systems are functions iterating over components.
- **EntityId** — stable 64-bit identifier; 0 is `NONE` (sentinel); allocated monotonically, never reused.
- **Lag compensation** — server rewinds the world in time (via the `SnapshotRing`) to validate actions the client took in its past. Hitscan rewinds targets to `command.snapshot_ack_tick` (ADR 0017).
- **Prediction (client-side)** — client simulates local player actions locally to hide latency; server corrects when mispredicted.
- **Reconciliation** — when client receives the authoritative server state for a tick it had already predicted, roll back and re-simulate from that point.
- **Snapshot** — complete world state at a specific tick, sent from server to client as an unreliable datagram.
- **Tick** — discrete simulation step (16.67 ms at 60 Hz).
